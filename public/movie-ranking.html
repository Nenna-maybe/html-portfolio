   <h3>Geostorm</h3>
      <p>"Geostorm," directed by Dean Devlin, is a disaster film that explores the consequences of climate control technology gone awry. Starring Gerard Butler as a satellite designer, the plot revolves around a series of catastrophic weather events triggered by a malfunctioning global network of satellites. While the film boasts impressive visual effects and thrilling action sequences, it suffers from a predictable storyline and underdeveloped characters. The dialogue often leans towards the clich√©d, and the scientific concepts can feel far-fetched. Despite its entertaining moments, "Geostorm" ultimately falls short of delivering a compelling narrative, making it a forgettable entry in the disaster genre.
